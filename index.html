    <h2 class="w3-wide">OUR SQUADRON</h2>
	<h3 class="w3-wide">Who are we?</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Are you up for fun, adventure, incredible experiences and making new friends? Are you looking for something to give you the edge in 
	life? Then welcome to the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO). Better known as the 'Air Cadets', we’re a UK-wide cadet force with more than 40,000 members aged 
	between 12 and 20 years.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">We're sponsored by the Royal Air Force and can give you hands-on experience of activities and courses that will challenge and develop 
	your skills to help you succeed in whatever you want to do.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">The ACO is made up of two areas:</p>
	<ul class="w3-justify">Air Training Corps - The ATC is the RAF's cadet force, divided into six regions, 34 wings and more than 900 squadrons within communities 
	around the UK</ul>
	<ul class="w3-justify">Combined Cadet Force (RAF) - The CCF (RAF) is our section of the CCF which is made up of cadets from all three services, coming together 
	in approximately 200 independent and state schools across the country</ul>
	<p class="w3-justify">Our aims are to:</p>
	<ul class="w3-justify">Promote and encourage a practical interest in aviation and the Royal Air Force among young people</ul>
	<ul class="w3-justify">Provide training which will be useful in the Services and civilian life</ul>
	<ul class="w3-justify">Encourage the spirit of adventure and develop qualities of leadership and good citizenship</ul>
	<p class="w3-justify">And there's one more important thing - it's a lot of fun!</p>	
	<h3 class="w3-wide">Ready for a challenge?</h3>
	<p class="w3-justify">As a cadet you'll have the opportunity to do things that others only dream about. Want real flight experience? No problem. How about 
	heading out on adventurous training and camps, sometimes overseas? Normal for cadets. Competitive sports, drill, shooting, music, abseiling, engineering 
	projects? Our list of activities is long, varied and open to all cadets. Yes it's a challenge, but that's what life's all about.</p>
    <h3 class="w3-wide">Get a head start</h3>	
	<p class="w3-justify">We are not a recruiting organisation for the RAF but if you're thinking about a Service career, cadet membership will put you ahead 
	of the competition. Many cadets go on to great success in the RAF (and the other Services). Around 40% of officers and 50% of all aircrew (including pilots,
	navigators and engineers) in the RAF now are ex-cadets. Research shows that they do better in basic training and stay in the Service longer than their 
	colleagues. Likewise, if you chose a civilian career our research proves you can go on the great things…employers just love the skills and experience that 
	air cadets offer.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Let's face it - where else would you be given the opportunity to fly solo in a glider or powered aircraft when you're 17? Whatever 
	you do with your life, at the end of your time as a cadet you'll be self-motivated, confident and ready for anything.</p>

  <!-- The Tour Section -->
  <div class="w3-black w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" id="intake">
	<h2 class="w3-wide">INTAKE NIGHTS</h2>
	<p class="w3-justify" align="center">We run intake evenings so that new cadets can join at the same time as other new cadets. We find that this helps a lot with making 
	new friends and settling in to the group. On an intake night, prospective new cadets come down to the squadron and watch a presentation about what we do, 
	parents are encouraged to come along to this as well. We then do some fun team-building and leadership exercises with the new cadets while the parents 
	complete some paperwork for those who want to join. They can then start attending regular parade nights.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">If you are interested in joining, please email us at 1116@aircadets.org and we will add you to the waiting list. We will then email you a reminder a week or two before 
	the next intake evening.</p>
